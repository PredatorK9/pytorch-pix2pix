# Pytorch-Pix2Pix

Implementation of Pix2Pix generative model <3  

This repo contains code to train the models based on [Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004)  

The model is trained on Map and Satelite image dataset with Map domain as the input domain and the Satelite images as the target domain.
